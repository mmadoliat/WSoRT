# Homework Assignment

Please complete the following tasks within **one week** and submit your work as a **GitHub repository**.

---

## 1. Extend the k-NN S3 Class (30 pts)

- **Different Distances**: Update your `knn_s3` implementation to support a `dist = c("sse", "sad")` argument for L1 and L2 distances.
- **Documentation**: Add **roxygen2** comments for the new argument and regenerate the help files using `devtools::document()`.

---

## 2. Shiny App Enhancement (30 pts)

- **Dynamic Predictors**: In the k-NN app, add a multi-select input that allows users to choose predictor variables at runtime.
- **Download Button**: Implement functionality to download the test-set predictions as a CSV file.

---

## 3. Rcpp Performance Study (30 pts)

- **Benchmark Script**: Create `benchmark_knn_dims.R` to compare runtimes for pure R vs Rcpp implementations across combinations of sample size $n \in \{500, 1000, 2000\}$ and feature count $p \in \{3, 5, 10\}$.
- **Summary Report**: Produce a one-page PDF summarizing your benchmarks, key code changes, and performance recommendations.

## Deliverables

Your GitHub repository should be organized as follows:

```
knn_workshop_hw/
├── R/           # R scripts and tests
├── app/         # Shiny app files
├── src/         # C++ source for Rcpp
├── benchmark_knn_dims.R
├── report.pdf   # summary of benchmarks and findings
└── README.md    # overview and instructions
```

The **README** must include:
- Setup instructions for all components
- A sample run demonstrating each part of the assignment

**Good luck, and feel free to reach out with any questions!**
