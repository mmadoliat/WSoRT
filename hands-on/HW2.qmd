# Homework Assignment 2

Please complete the following tasks within **one week** and submit your work as a **GitHub repository**.\
Include your **GitHub repository link** in your submission so the instructor can review your code, package, and collaboration history.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Python Integration with R using Reticulate (30 pts)

-   **Python Script**: Create a Python script `model.py` that defines at least one function (e.g., `square_numbers(x)`) and a small PyTorch or NumPy model.
-   **Reticulate in R**: From R, use `reticulate` to:
    -   Import and call your Python function(s)
    -   Pass data from R to Python and back
    -   Generate a plot in Python (e.g., matplotlib) but called from R, and save it under `images/`
-   **Documentation**: Use **roxygen2** comments in your R script to document the functions that interact with Python, and regenerate help files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Develop Your Own Professional R Package (40 pts)

-   **Package Setup**: Create a new R package (e.g., `myutils`) in RStudio.
-   **Functionality**: Add at least two R functions of your choice.
-   **Dataset**: Include at least one dataset in your package and document it.
-   **Documentation**: Document all functions and datasets with **roxygen2**.
-   **Build**: Install and load your package locally to verify functionality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Collaborate via GitHub (20 pts)

-   **Repository Setup**: Push your package and Python–R integration work to a GitHub repository.
-   **Collaboration**:
    -   Invite a classmate as a collaborator
    -   They must create a new branch, add or improve a function, commit, and push
    -   They must create a Pull Request (PR) for you to review
    -   Merge the PR into your main branch
-   **Evidence**: Include screenshots of:
    -   The PR discussion
    -   The commit history showing contributions
    -   The merge confirmation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Deliverables

Your GitHub repository should be organized as follows:

``` text
hw2_reticulate_package/
├── R/ # R functions and roxygen2 docs
├── data/ # datasets for your package
├── python/ # Python scripts (model.py, etc.)
├── images/ # generated plots
├── README.md # overview and instructions
└── DESCRIPTION # package metadata
```

The **README** must include: - Setup instructions for R and Python dependencies - Instructions to reproduce all results and plots - Your collaborator’s name and their contribution - The GitHub repository link

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Good luck, and remember to commit and push often!**
